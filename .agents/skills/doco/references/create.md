<!-- doco:managed template=v1 -->
# Create

1. Decide whether a tracked change is actually requested or useful. Creating a
   doco change is not required for routine behavior fixes or implementation
   details, and doco is not an implementation-history mechanism. Create one when
   the user requests tracking or the goal benefits from durable design,
   coordination, handoff or lifecycle review. Run `doco list`; reuse an active ID
   for the same goal instead of fragmenting follow-up work into new changes.
2. Read current architecture, relevant specs, effective ADRs and actual source
   and tests. Exclude unrelated active changes, completed snapshots, archived
   history and tmp unless explicitly needed. CLI context is a path aid, not a
   semantic relevance engine.
3. For a new goal, agree on a unique lowercase-hyphen ID. Use `doco new <id>
   --proposal-only` only when intended behavior and acceptance fit completely in
   proposal.md, no unresolved design choice or dependent task breakdown is needed,
   and one implementer can safely execute and verify it directly. Otherwise use
   `doco new <id>` for the default full package. Templates under `../templates/`
   are skeletons, not finished designs; replace every TODO placeholder. The mode
   is explicit: never infer it from line count or silently omit files from a full
   package.
4. Write proposal: problem, motivation, scope, non-goals, acceptance criteria and
   intended contract changes; set Result to Pending until delivered. It must
   remain understandable after all of work/ is deleted.
5. For a full package, write work/implement.md: actual baseline and affected source entry points;
   distinguish existing from planned APIs. Cover module boundaries, call/data
   flow, API signatures, error semantics, state ownership, lifetime, persistence,
   concurrency and compatibility where relevant. Specify algorithm steps,
   invariants, edge cases, failure handling and resource/performance constraints.
   A Git commit is only a locator; also account for uncommitted relevant changes.
6. Close correctness/architecture/API/core-algorithm decisions before handing off.
   State fixed choices versus local discretion, blocking open questions,
   verification and current-document impact (explicitly none when appropriate).
7. For a full package, write work/tasks.md: `- [ ] 1.1 action`, stable unique two-level positive-integer
   IDs (`1.1`, `1.2`, `2.1`; no zero or leading zero), Acceptance lines,
   Dependencies lines where needed, and a final verification task. Dependencies
   must exist and be acyclic. Include document updates only if actually affected.
   Use relative package links; cross-change references use `doco:<stable-id>`.
8. Run `doco check <id>` and resolve mechanical errors. Review semantic design
   completeness yourself: another implementer must not have to invent key choices.

Generate optional visual HTML only on request in `doco/tmp/<id>/`; it is a
throwaway explanation, never requirements or execution state.
